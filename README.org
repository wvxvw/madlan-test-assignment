* Installing
  The project is hosted at Github, clone the repository and run =bower=
  to fetch dependencies.
  #+begin_src sh
    git clone https://github.com/wvxvw/madlan-test-assignment.git
    sudo npm install -g bower
    cd ./madlan-test-assignment
    bower install
  #+end_src
  =bower= tool should create the =bower_components= directory.  This project
  depends on Twitter Bootstrap, Flot, JQuery, React and Underscore libraries.

  In case you cannot run bower, you will need to fetch all those projects on
  your own.  Below is the list of repositories:

  #+begin_src sh
    mkdir bower_components
    cd bower_components
    git clone git://github.com/twbs/bootstrap.git
    git clone git://github.com/jquery/jquery.git
    git clone git://github.com/flot/flot.git
    git clone git://github.com/facebook/react-bower.git
    git clone git://github.com/jashkenas/underscore.git
  #+end_src

* Running
  The project comes with a minimal HTTP server for testing.  To
  run the server:
  #+begin_src sh
    cd ./server
    ./dev-server.py
  #+end_src
  See =dev-server.py --help= for additional options.

  After you started the server, the project will be accessbile at
  http://locahost:8080.
